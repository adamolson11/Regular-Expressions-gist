# Title Explaining Regular Expressions

It all comes down to pattern matching with text. This gist is about understanding each component, what it is and does etc. 

## Summary
 For this assignment I chose to use this regular expression. /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/, 
 This is the one that is responsible for matching email addresses. Refer to the table of contents below for a further explanation of each of the 
 components that make up a regular expression. We will go over each in detail.
